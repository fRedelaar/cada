Community-aware detection of anomalies

Code for detecting node anomalies in networks with NetworkX by including community structure from two out-of-the-box community detection algorithm: (1) Louvain [1], and (2) Infomap [2]

For (1), Python package <a href="https://github.com/taynaud/python-louvain">Python-Louvain</a> is used. 

For (2), Python package <a href="https://pypi.org/project/infomap/">Infomap</a> is used.
